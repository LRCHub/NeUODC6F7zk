[00:10.01] Oh heli, Oh heli
[00:11.07] I'm crouching here with a telescope in hand
[00:17.12] Looking out across our lego land
[00:20.12] I really think it's about time that she came down
[00:23.14] She a laughing giggly whirlybird
[00:30.16] She got to be obscene to be obheard
[00:35.27] I really think its about time that she came down
[00:59.27] 
[00:41.29] And I object to all the air male that she pick up
[00:43.28] The air male that she pick up
[00:45.22] The air male that she pick up
[00:59.72] 
[00:47.22] When she's up there twirling round
[00:52.38] Just like a helicopter - copter
[00:55.38] She's landing on the town
[00:59.30] It's about time that I stopped her - stopped her
[01:02.40] When she's up there twirling round
[01:06.46] Just like a helicopter - copter
[01:10.53] Oh heli - Oh heli
[01:19.03] 
[01:14.56] Now she's away from convent she's gone wild
[01:18.52] Grown from a nice young lady to a child
[01:22.65] I really think its about time that she came down
[01:28.65] She a laughing giggly whirlybird
[01:32.78] She got to be obscene to be obheard
[01:36.77] I really think it's about time that she came down
[02:01.27] 
[01:42.76] And I object to all the air male that she pick up
[01:44.87] The air male that she pick up
[01:46.76] The air male that she pick up
[02:01.26] 
[01:47.82] When she's up there twirling round
[01:49.81] Just like a helicopter - copter
[01:57.95] She's landing on the town
[02:00.94] It's about time that I stopped her - stopped her
[02:04.08] When she's up there twirling round
[02:09.05] Just like a helicopter - copter
[02:12.19] Oh heli - Oh heli
[02:20.69] 
[02:18.12] When she's up there twirling round
[02:48.38] Just like a helicopter - copter
[02:51.43] She's landing on the town
[02:55.48] It's about time that I stopped her - stopped her
[02:58.45] When she's up there twirling round
[03:02.53] Just like a helicopter - copter
[03:06.57] Oh heli - Oh heli - Oh heli
[03:20.07] 
[03:11.57] When she's up there twirling round
[03:15.65] Like a helicopter - copter
[03:18.66] She's landing on the town, Look out, town
[03:22.76] It's about time that I stopped her - stopped her
[03:25.75] When she's up there floating round, round, round, round...
[03:33.86] Oh heli - Oh heli
