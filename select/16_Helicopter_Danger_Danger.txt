See the sky (so cold and black)
Feel the night (breathe on your back)
Hear the sound (a silent scream)
Come to wake you (from your dream
Cross your heart (and hope to die)
I feel your fear (it feeds my soul)
Disappear (to the unknown)
I?
M the truth that you can?
T outrun
Look up to the sky
I?
M always out there
Open up your eyes()(1)(B-2)()
