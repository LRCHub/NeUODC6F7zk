Take my hand and pray with me
My final days in company
The devil now has come for me
And helicopters circling the scene
And I pray for us
Could you pray for us
We know he loves you the best
We know he loves you the best
Lights inside my cave
Tired of my pain
I'm tired of my pain, oh
All these drugs they play
All leave in these terrible ways
They don't pay like they use to pay
I used to make it day to day
No one cares for me
I have minimal needs
I keep no company
And now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
